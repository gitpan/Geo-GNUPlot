Geo::GNUPlot

DESCRIPTION
	This program plots a set of latitude/longitude pairs as a track on a world map
	using gnuplot. The plot radius is determined by a user defined radius function.

	See the examples and pod documentation for more information.

PREREQUISITES
	gnuplot
	IO::File

INSTALLATION
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

	Make sure that you copy the world map file in examples/w2.dat
	to a useful location where it won't get lost.

TODO
	The linear interpolation function appears to
	occassionally have problems.  It may
	be that a better algorithm is needed, or
	it may be a problem in how gnuplot visualizes
	the data.  I simply do not have the time to
	investigate and resolve the issue.

REVISION HISTORY
	0.01    Nov 1999 - Initial version.
